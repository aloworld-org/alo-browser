//! The window and its event loop: the one file that may name `winit` (ADR
//! 0024 § 1).
//!
//! # What the event loop does, and what it never does
//!
//! It turns what the window server says into [`Order`]s for the conductor,
//! takes in the conductor's [`News`], and draws the window from what it has
//! been sent ([`crate::showing`], [`crate::compose`]). It **never calls a
//! renderer** and never waits on the conductor (ADR 0024 § 2): every exchange
//! with a renderer is on the conductor's thread, and what it learnt arrives
//! here through `winit`'s own proxy, as an event like any other.
//!
//! # What it does not do yet
//!
//! A person's pointer and keys reach no page: that is item 298, which decides
//! which frame a point falls in and sends it to that frame's renderer. There is
//! no tab strip (item 297), and the window shows the selected tab — today, the
//! only one.
//!
//! # The title
//!
//! The window is called "alo", and never a page's title: a title is a
//! stranger's string, and the window server would shape it in this, the
//! privileged process (ADR 0024 § 4). A tab's title is the tab strip's, which
//! is rendered in a sandboxed renderer of its own.
//!
//! # No `unsafe`
//!
//! Every `winit` function called here — `EventLoop::with_user_event`,
//! `EventLoopBuilder::build`, `EventLoop::create_proxy`, `EventLoop::run_app`,
//! `EventLoopProxy::send_event`, `ActiveEventLoop::create_window`,
//! `ActiveEventLoop::exit`, `Window::inner_size`, `Window::scale_factor` and
//! `Window::request_redraw` — is a safe function in `winit` 0.30.13's source,
//! which the commit adding this file checked (ADR 0024 § 1's stop rule).
