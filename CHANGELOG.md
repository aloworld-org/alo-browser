What changed, in words a person outside this repository can read. Newest first.

## Unreleased

- **There is a document tree.** `html5ever` parses HTML and alo browser holds
  the result: nodes, attributes, parents and children, in our own types rather
  than the parser's. A document round trips — parse it, write it back out, and
  the text is the same — and malformed input still produces a usable tree, with
  a record of everything the parser had to repair to get one.
- **Every node has an identity that is never reused** (ADR 0003). An id names a
  node for the life of its document, and a node that leaves the tree keeps it,
  so a stale id names something that is gone rather than something else that is
  not. This exists in the first commit of the tree because the agent surface
  will stand on it, and identity cannot be retrofitted.
- **Quirks mode is recorded and never honoured.** A document that would put
  another engine into quirks mode is laid out as standards, because law 1
  refuses quirks mode outright. What the parser observed is kept for
  diagnostics rather than thrown away.
- `unsafe` is now forbidden by the compiler rather than by review, across the
  whole workspace.
- The scope is written down: what gets built, in which stage, and what will not
  be built at all. The engine renders the modern platform and refuses thirty
  years of legacy — no quirks mode, no floats-as-layout, no CSS-table layout —
  because refusing them is what makes a project this size survivable. Stage 1
  needs no JavaScript engine, which removes a browser's largest single component
  from the critical path.
- alo browser exists as a decision and a queue. Nothing renders yet.
